REKT was supposed to be a language from Hed0rizer but then turned out to be a brainfuck interpretator.

##USAGE:
	
REKT -f file [-s size] [-b]

	-f specifies an input file
	-s specifies memory size in bytes, default is 1024
	-b enables "brainfuck mode", which interpretates brainfuck

Windows-only since I'm using retarded conio.h

##TODO:

	(?) add different "languages" support
	(!) add out-of-memory tracking to prevent crashes
	(!) make it not win-only
