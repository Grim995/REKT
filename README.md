REKT was supposed to be a language from Hed0rizer but then turned out to be a brainfuck interpretator.

##USAGE:
	
REKT -f file [-s size] [-i file]

	-f specifies a source file
	-m specifies memory size in bytes, default is 1024
	-i sets an input file

Not more Windows-only since I deleted conio.h!

##DONE

	(!) add out-of-memory tracking to prevent crashes
	(!) make it not win-only
	
##TODO:

	(?) add different "languages" support (useless)
